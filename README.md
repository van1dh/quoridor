# Quoridor

## Overview

This project implements the classic board game **Quoridor** in Java, following a modular and extensible architecture that supports multiple turn-based game variants.

The current implementation provides:
- Full game logic (movement, wall placement, win conditions)
- CLI interface with real-time board visualization
- Error handling for illegal moves
- Turn-based gameplay loop
- Extensibility for future game variants

## How to Compile and Run

Ensure you have **Java 17+** and **Gradle** installed.

### Clone the project:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
```

### Run Tests:
```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Run the CLI game:
```bash
./gradlew run
```

## How to Play

Players take turns entering moves.

Valid commands include:

- step x y — Move pawn to position (x, y)

- wall x y H — Place a horizontal wall at (x, y)

- wall x y V — Place a vertical wall at (x, y)

- resign — Concede the match

- quit — Exit the game without finishing
